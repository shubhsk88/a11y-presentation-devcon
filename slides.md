# A11y Principles

- Perceivable
-  Operable
-  Understanble
-  Robust

<!--
This principle states that users must be able to perceive all essential information on the screen, and it must be conveyed to multiple senses.
users must be able to operate the digital product's interface. The interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.
This principle focuses on supporting assistive technologies and ensuring that, as devices and user agents evolve, the digital product remains accessible

Perceivable->Ensuring color is not the only method of conveying meaning.
OPerable-> Adding keyboard and touchscreen support to all active elements.
Understandable-> Ensuring error messages are clear and easy to resolve
Robust-> Testing keyboard-only navigation.
Testing with different screen reader technologies.

Mobility->Elements that are only designed to work with the use of a mouse.

Hearing-> D/deafness, hard of hearing (HoH), hearing impaired (HI
Content without transcript

 Down's syndrome, A/autism, ADHD, dyslexia, aphasia.
Busy interfaces that make it overly complicated to focus on the task at hand, big walls of words with little whitespace, justified text, and small or hard-to-read fonts.
